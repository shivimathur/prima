function setdrop_tr(kopt, ximproved, bmat, d, delta, rho, xpt, zmat) result(knew)
!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
! This subroutine sets KNEW to the index of the interpolation point to be deleted AFTER A TRUST
! REGION STEP. KNEW will be set in a way ensuring that the geometry of XPT is "optimal" after
! XPT(:, KNEW) is replaced with XNEW = XOPT + D, where D is the trust-region step. See discussions
! around (6.1) of the BOBYQA paper.
! N.B.:
! 1. If XIMPROVED = TRUE, then KNEW > 0 so that XNEW is included into XPT. Otherwise, it is a bug.
! 2. If XIMPROVED = FALSE, then KNEW /= KOPT so that XPT(:, KOPT) stays. Otherwise, it is a bug.
! 3. It is tempting to take the function value into consideration when defining KNEW, for example,
! set KNEW so that FVAL(KNEW) = MAX(FVAL) as long as F(XNEW) < MAX(FVAL), unless there is a better
! choice. However, this is not a good idea, because the definition of KNEW should benefit the
! quality of the model that interpolates f at XPT. A set of points with low function values is not
! necessarily a good interpolation set. In contrast, a good interpolation set needs to include
! points with relatively high function values; otherwise, the interpolant will unlikely reflect the
! landscape of the function sufficiently.

! Calculation starts !
!====================!

! Calculate the distance squares between the interpolation points and the "optimal point". When
! identifying the optimal point, it is reasonable to take into account the new trust-region trial
! point XPT(:, KOPT) + D, which will become the optimal point in the next iteration if XIMPROVED
! is TRUE. Powell suggested this in
! - (56) of the UOBYQA paper, lines 276--297 of uobyqb.f,
! - (7.5) and Box 5 of the NEWUOA paper, lines 383--409 of newuob.f,
! - the last paragraph of page 26 of the BOBYQA paper, lines 435--465 of bobyqb.f.
! However, Powell's LINCOA code is different. In his code, the KNEW after a trust-region step is
! picked in lines 72--96 of the update.f for LINCOA, where DISTSQ is calculated as the square of the
! distance to XPT(KOPT, :) (Powell recorded the interpolation points in rows). However, note that
! the trust-region trial point has not been included into XPT yet --- it cannot be included without
! knowing KNEW (see lines 332-344 and 404--431 of lincob.f). Hence Powell's LINCOA code picks KNEW
! based on the distance to the un-updated "optimal point", which is unreasonable. This has been
! corrected in our implementation of LINCOA, yet it does not boost the performance.
if (ximproved) then
    ! distsq = sum((xpt - spread(xpt(:, kopt) + d, dim=2, ncopies=npt))**2, dim=1)
    !!MATLAB: distsq = sum((xpt - (xpt(:, kopt) + d)).^2)  % d should be a column! Implicit expansion

weight = max(ONE, distsq / rho**2)**4
! Other possible definitions of WEIGHT.
! !weight = max(ONE, distsq / rho**2)**3.5  ! Quite similar to power 4
! !weight = max(ONE, distsq / rho**2)**3  ! Not bad
! !weight = max(ONE, distsq / delta**2)**2  ! Powell's code. Does not works as well as the above.
! !weight = max(ONE, distsq / rho**2)**2  ! Similar to Powell's code, not better.
! !weight = max(ONE, distsq / delta**2)  ! Defined in (6.1) of the BOBYQA paper. It works poorly!
! !weight = max(ONE, distsq / max(TENTH * delta, rho)**2)**3.5  ! The same as DISTSQ/RHO**2.
! The following WEIGHT all perform a bit worse than the above one.
! !weight = max(ONE, distsq / delta**2)**3.5
! !weight = max(ONE, distsq / delta**2)**2.5

! !weight = max(ONE, distsq / rho**2)**4.5

! Different from NEWUOA/LINCOA, the possibility that entries in DEN become negative is handled by
! RESCUE. Hence the SCORE here uses DEN in contrast to ABS(DEN) in NEWUOA/LINCOA.
den = calden(kopt, bmat, d, xpt, zmat)
score = weight * den

! If the new F is not better than FVAL(KOPT), we set SCORE(KOPT) = -1 to avoid KNEW = KOPT.
if (.not. ximproved) then
    score(kopt) = -ONE
end if

! SCORE(K) = NaN implies DEN(K) = NaN. We exclude such K as we want DEN to be big.
score(trueloc(is_nan(score))) = -ONE

knew = 0
! The following IF works slightly better than `IF (ANY(SCORE > 0))` from Powell's BOBYQA/LINCOA code.
if (any(score > 1) .or. (ximproved .and. any(score > 0))) then  ! Powell's UOBYQA and NEWUOA code.
    ! See (6.1) of the BOBYQA paper for the definition of KNEW in this case.
    knew = int(maxloc(score, dim=1), kind(knew))
    !!MATLAB: [~, knew] = max(score);
end if

! Powell's code does not include the following instructions. With Powell's code, if DEN consists of
! only NaN, then KNEW can be 0 even when XIMPROVED is TRUE. Here, we set KNEW to the following value,
! to make sure that the new trial point is included in the interpolation set. However, the updating
! subroutine will likely need to skip the update of the Lagrange polynomials (i.e., H), or they
! would be destroyed by the NaNs.
if ((ximproved .and. knew == 0) .or. knew < 0) then  ! KNEW < 0 is impossible in theory.
    knew = int(maxloc(distsq, dim=1), kind(knew))

function geostep(knew, kopt, bmat, delbar, sl, su, xpt, zmat) result(d)
!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
! This subroutine finds a step D that intends to improve the geometry of the interpolation set
! when XPT(:, KNEW) is changed to XOPT + D, where XOPT = XPT(:, KOPT). See Section 3 of the BOBYQA
! paper, particularly the discussions starting from (3.7).
!
! The arguments XPT, BMAT, ZMAT, SL and SU all have the same meanings as in BOBYQB.
! KOPT is the index of the optimal interpolation point.
! KNEW is the index of the interpolation point that is going to be moved.
! DELBAR is the trust region bound for the geometry step.
! XLINE will be a suitable new position for the interpolation point XPT(:, KNEW). Specifically, it
!   satisfies the SL, SU and trust region bounds and it should provide a large denominator in the
!   next call of UPDATE. The step XLINE-XOPT from XOPT is restricted to moves along the straight
!   lines through XOPT and another interpolation point.
! XCAUCHY provides a large value of the modulus of the KNEW-th Lagrange function subject to the
!   constraints that have been mentioned, its main difference from XLINE being that XCAUCHY-XOPT
!   is a bound-constrained version of the Cauchy step within the trust region.

! Search for a large denominator along the straight lines through XOPT and another interpolation
! point, subject to the bound constraints and the trust region. According to these constraints, SLBD
! and SUBD will be lower and upper bounds on the step along each of these lines in turn. On each
! line, we will evaluate the value of the KNEW-th Lagrange function at 3 trial points, and estimate
! the denominator accordingly. The three points take the form (1-t)*XOPT + t*XPT(:, K) with step
! lengths t = SLBD, SUBD, and STPM, corresponding to the upper (U) bound of t, the lower (L) bound
! of t, and a medium (M) step. In total, 3*(NPT-1) trial points will be considered. On the K-th line,
! we intend to maximize the modulus of PHI_K(t) = LFUNC((1-t)*XOPT + t*XPT(:,K)); overall, we intend
! to find a trial point rendering a large value of the PREDSQ defined in (3.11) of the BOBYQA paper.
!
! We start with the following DO loop, the purpose of which is to define two 3-by-NPT arrays STPLEN
! and ISBD. For each K, STPLEN(1:3, K) and ISBD(1:3, K) corresponds to the straight line through
! XOPT and XPT(:, K). STPLEN(1:3, K) contains SLBD, SUBD, and STPM in this order, which are the step
! lengths for the three trial points on this line. The three entries of SBDI(1:3, K) indicate
! whether the corresponding trial points lie on bounds; SBDI(I, K) = J > 0 means that the I-th trail
! point on the K-th line attains the J-th upper bound, SBDI(I, K) = -J < 0 indicates reaching the
! J-th lower bound, and SBDI(I, K) = 0 means not touching any bound.

! Locate the trial point the renders the maximum of PREDSQ. It is the ISQ-th trial point on the

! N.B.: 1. The strategy is a bit different from Powell's original code. In Powell's code and the
! BOBYQA paper, we first select the trial point that gives the largest value of ABS(VLAG) on each
! straight line, and then maximize PREDSQ among the (NPT-1) selected points. Here we maximize PREDSQ
! among all the trial points. It works slightly better than Powell's version in a test on 20220428.
! Powell's version is as follows.
!---------------------------------------------------------------------!
!isqs = int(maxloc(abs(vlag), dim=1), kind(isqs))  ! SIZE(ISQS) = NPT
!ksq = int(maxloc([(predsq(isqs(k), k), k=1, npt)], dim=1), kind(ksq))
!isq = isqs(ksq)
!---------------------------------------------------------------------!
! 2. Recall that we have set the NaN entries of PREDSQ to zero, if there is any. Thus the KSQS below
! is a well defined integer array, all the three entries lying between 1 and NPT.
ksqs = int(maxloc(predsq, dim=2), kind(ksqs))
isq = int(maxloc([predsq(1, ksqs(1)), predsq(2, ksqs(2)), predsq(3, ksqs(3))], dim=1), kind(isq))
ksq = ksqs(isq)
!!MATLAB:
!![~, ksqs] = max(predsq, [], 'omitnan');
!![~, isq] = max([predsq(1, ksqs(1)), predsq(2, ksqs(2)), predsq(3, ksqs(3))]);
!!ksq = ksqs(isq);

! Construct XLINE in a way that satisfies the bound constraints exactly.
stpsiz = stplen(isq, ksq)
ibd = isbd(isq, ksq)

xline = max(sl, min(su, xopt + stpsiz * (xpt(:, ksq) - xopt)))
if (ibd < 0) then
    xline(-ibd) = sl(-ibd)
end if
if (ibd > 0) then
    xline(ibd) = su(ibd)
end if

! Calculate DENOM for the current choice of D. Indeed, only DEN_LINE(KNEW) is needed.

! The following IF ... END IF does not exist in Powell's code. SURPRISINGLY, the performance of
! BOBYQA on bound constrained problems (but NOT unconstrained ones) is evidently improved by this IF
! ... END IF, which means to try the Cauchy step only in the late stage of the algorithm, e.g., when
! DELBAR is relatively small. WHY? In the following condition, 1.0E-2 works well if we use
! DEN_CAUCHY to decide whether to take the Cauchy step; 1.0E-3 works well if we use VLAGSQ instead.
! How to make this condition adaptive? A naive idea is to replace the thresholds to,
! e.g.,1.0E-2*RHOBEG. However, in a test on 20220517, this adaptation worsened the performance. In
! such a test, RHOBEG must take a value that is quite different from one. We tried RHOBEG = 0.9E-2.
