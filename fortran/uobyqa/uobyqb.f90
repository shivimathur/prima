! This subroutine performs the major calculations of UOBYQA.
!
! The arguments N, X, RHOBEG, RHOEND, IPRINT and MAXFUN are identical to the corresponding arguments
! in subroutine UOBYQA.
!
! XBASE will contain a shift of origin that reduces the contributions from rounding errors to values
!   of the model and Lagrange functions.
! XBASE holds a shift of origin that should reduce the contributions from rounding errors to values
!   of the model and Lagrange functions.
! XOPT is the displacement from XBASE of the best vector of variables so far (i.e., the one provides
!   the least calculated F so far). FOPT = F(XOPT + XBASE). However, we do not save XOPT and FOPT
!   explicitly, because XOPT = XPT(:, KOPT) and FOPT = FVAL(KOPT), which is explained below.
! [XPT, FVAL, KOPT] describes the interpolation set:
! XPT contains the interpolation points relative to XBASE, each COLUMN for a point; FVAL holds the
!   values of F at the interpolation points; KOPT is the index of XOPT in XPT.
! PQ will contain the parameters of the quadratic model.
! PL will contain the parameters of the Lagrange functions.
! D is reserved for trial steps from XOPT. It is chosen by subroutine TRSTEP or GEOSTEP. Usually
!   XBASE + XOPT + D is the vector of variables for the next call of CALFUN.

! If DELTA <= GAMMA3*RHO after an update, we set DELTA to RHO. GAMMA3 must be less than GAMMA2. The

! Then TRRAD will update DELTA to GAMMA2*RHO. If GAMMA3 >= GAMMA2, then DELTA will be reset to RHO,
! which is not reasonable as D is very successful. See paragraph two of Sec. 5.2.5 in
! T. M. Ragonneau's thesis: "Model-Based Derivative-Free Optimization Methods and Software".
! According to test on 20230613, for UOBYQA, this Powellful updating scheme of DELTA works better
! than setting directly DELTA = MAX(NEW_DELTA, RHO).

! MAXTR is the maximal number of trust-region iterations. Here, we set it to HUGE(MAXTR) so that

! each trust-region iteration takes 1 or 2 function evaluations unless the trust-region step is short
! or fails to reduce the trust-region model but the geometry step is not invoked.
! N.B.: Do NOT set MAXTR to HUGE(MAXTR), as it may cause overflow and infinite cycling in the DO
! loop. See

    !----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
    ! Before the next trust-region iteration, we may improve the geometry of XPT or reduce RHO
    ! according to IMPROVE_GEO and REDUCE_RHO, which in turn depend on the following indicators.
    ! N.B.: We must ensure that the algorithm does not set IMPROVE_GEO = TRUE at infinitely many
    ! consecutive iterations without moving XOPT or reducing RHO. Otherwise, the algorithm will get
    ! stuck in repetitive invocations of GEOSTEP. To this end, make sure the following.
    ! 1. The threshold for CLOSE_ITPSET is at least DELBAR, the trust region radius for GEOSTEP.
    ! Normally, DELBAR <= DELTA <= the threshold (In Powell's UOBYQA, DELBAR = RHO < the threshold).
    ! 2. If an iteration sets IMPROVE_GEO = TRUE, it must also reduce DELTA or set DELTA to RHO.

    ! ACCURATE_MOD: Are the recent models sufficiently accurate? Used only if SHORTD is TRUE.
    accurate_mod = all(abs(moderr_rec) <= 0.125_RP * crvmin * rho**2) .and. all(dnorm_rec <= rho)
    ! ADEQUATE_GEO: Is the geometry of the interpolation set "adequate"?
    adequate_geo = (shortd .and. accurate_mod) .or. close_itpset
    ! SMALL_TRRAD: Is the trust-region radius small? This indicator seems not impactive in practice.
    small_trrad = (max(delta, dnorm) <= rho)  ! Behaves the same as Powell's version.
    !small_trrad = (dnorm <= rho)  ! Powell's code.

    ! Comments on ACCURATE_MOD:
    ! 1. ACCURATE_MOD is needed only when SHORTD is TRUE.
    ! 2. In Powell's UOBYQA code, ACCURATE_MOD is defined according to (28), (37), and (38) in the
    ! UOBYQA paper (see also (32) of Powell 2001: "On the Lagrange functions of quadratic models
    ! that are defined by interpolation"). As elaborated in Sec. 3 of the paper (also Sec. 4 of
    ! Powell 2001), the idea is to test whether the current model is sufficiently accurate by
    ! checking whether the interpolation error bound in (28) is (sufficiently) small. If the bound
    ! is small, then set ACCURATE_MOD to TRUE. Otherwise, it identifies a "bad" interpolation point
    ! that makes a significant contribution to the bound, with a preference to the interpolation
    ! points that are far away from the current trust-region center. Such a point will be replaced
    ! with a new point obtained by the geometry step. If all the interpolation points are close
    ! enough to the trust-region center, then they are all considered to be good.
    ! 3. Our implementation defines ACCURATE_MOD by a method from NEWUOA and BOBYQA, which is also
    ! reflected in LINCOA. It sets ACCURATE_MOD to TRUE if recent model errors and step lengths are
    ! all small. In addition, it identifies a "bad" interpolation point by simply taking the
    ! farthest point from the current trust region center, unless they are all close enough to the
    ! center. This implementation is much simpler and less costly in terms of flops yet it performs
    ! almost the same as Powell's original implementation.

    ! Powell's original definition of IMPROVE_GEO and REDUCE_RHO:
    ! !bad_trstep = (shortd .or. knew_tr == 0 .or. (ratio <= 0 .and. dnorm <= 2.0_RP*rho .and. ddmove <= 4.0_RP * rho**2))
    ! !improve_geo = bad_trstep .and. .not. (shortd .and. accurate_mod) .and. .not. close_itpset
    ! !reduce_rho = bad_trstep .and. dnorm <= rho .and. .not. improve_geo

    ! IMPROVE_GEO and REDUCE_RHO are defined as follows.
    ! N.B.: If SHORTD is TRUE at the very first iteration, then REDUCE_RHO will be set to TRUE.
    ! Powell's code does not have TRFAIL in BAD_TRSTEP; it terminates if TRFAIL is TRUE.

    ! BAD_TRSTEP (for IMPROVE_GEO): Is the last trust-region step bad? For UOBYQA, it is CRUCIAL to
    ! include DMOVE <= 4.0_RP*RHO**2 in the definition of BAD_TRSTEP for IMPROVE_GEO.
    bad_trstep = (shortd .or. trfail .or. (ratio <= eta1 .and. ddmove <= 4.0_RP * delta**2) .or. knew_tr == 0)
    !bad_trstep = (shortd .or. trfail .or. ratio <= eta1 .or. knew_tr == 0)  ! Works poorly!
    improve_geo = bad_trstep .and. .not. adequate_geo
    ! BAD_TRSTEP (for REDUCE_RHO): Is the last trust-region step bad?
    bad_trstep = (shortd .or. trfail .or. ratio <= 0 .or. knew_tr == 0)  ! Performs better than the one below from Powell.
    !bad_trstep = (shortd .or. trfail .or. (ratio <= 0 .and. ddmove <= 4.0_RP * delta**2) .or. knew_tr == 0)
    reduce_rho = bad_trstep .and. adequate_geo .and. small_trrad

    ! Equivalently, REDUCE_RHO can be set as follows. It shows that REDUCE_RHO is TRUE in two cases.
    ! !bad_trstep = (shortd .or. trfail .or. (ratio <= 0 .and. ddmove <= 4.0_RP * delta**2) .or. knew_tr == 0)
    ! !reduce_rho = (shortd .and. accurate_mod) .or. (bad_trstep .and. close_itpset .and. small_trrad)

    ! With REDUCE_RHO properly defined, we can also set IMPROVE_GEO as follows.
