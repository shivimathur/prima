function setdrop_tr(idz, kopt, ximproved, bmat, d, delta, rho, xpt, zmat) result(knew)
!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
! This subroutine sets KNEW to the index of the interpolation point to be deleted AFTER A TRUST
! REGION STEP. KNEW will be set in a way ensuring that the geometry of XPT is "optimal" after
! XPT(:, KNEW) is replaced with XNEW = XOPT + D, where D is the trust-region step.
! N.B.:
! It is tempting to take the function value into consideration when defining KNEW, for example,
! set KNEW so that FVAL(KNEW) = MAX(FVAL) as long as F(XNEW) < MAX(FVAL), unless there is a better
! choice. However, this is not a good idea, because the definition of KNEW should benefit the
! quality of the model that interpolates f at XPT. A set of points with low function values is not
! necessarily a good interpolation set. In contrast, a good interpolation set needs to include
! points with relatively high function values; otherwise, the interpolant will unlikely reflect the
! landscape of the function sufficiently.

! Calculation starts !
!====================!

! Calculate the distance squares between the interpolation points and the "optimal point". When
! identifying the optimal point, it is reasonable to take into account the new trust-region trial
! point XPT(:, KOPT) + D, which will become the optimal point in the next iteration if XIMPROVED
! is TRUE. Powell suggested this in
! - (56) of the UOBYQA paper, lines 276--297 of uobyqb.f,
! - (7.5) and Box 5 of the NEWUOA paper, lines 383--409 of newuob.f,
! - the last paragraph of page 26 of the BOBYQA paper, lines 435--465 of bobyqb.f.
! However, Powell's LINCOA code is different. In his code, the KNEW after a trust-region step is
! picked in lines 72--96 of the update.f for LINCOA, where DISTSQ is calculated as the square of the
! distance to XPT(KOPT, :) (Powell recorded the interpolation points in rows). However, note that
! the trust-region trial point has not been included into XPT yet --- it cannot be included without
! knowing KNEW (see lines 332-344 and 404--431 of lincob.f). Hence Powell's LINCOA code picks KNEW
! based on the distance to the un-updated "optimal point", which is unreasonable. This has been
! corrected in our implementation of LINCOA, yet it does not boost the performance.
! if (ximproved) then
!     distsq = sum((xpt - spread(xpt(:, kopt) + d, dim=2, ncopies=npt))**2, dim=1)
!     !!MATLAB: distsq = sum((xpt - (xpt(:, kopt) + d)).^2)  % d should be a column!! Implicit expansion
! else
!     distsq = sum((xpt - spread(xpt(:, kopt), dim=2, ncopies=npt))**2, dim=1)
!     !!MATLAB: distsq = sum((xpt - xpt(:, kopt)).^2)  % Implicit expansion
! end if
!distsq = sum((xpt - spread(xpt(:, kopt), dim=2, ncopies=npt))**2, dim=1)  ! Powell's code

weight = max(ONE, distsq / max(TENTH * delta, rho)**2)**3  ! Powell's NEWUOA code
! Other possible definitions of WEIGHT.
! !weight = distsq**2  ! Powell's code. WRONG.
! !weight = max(ONE, distsq / max(TENTH * delta, rho)**2)**2.5  ! Worse than power 3
! !weight = max(ONE, distsq / max(TENTH * delta, rho)**2)**3.5  ! Worse than power 3
! !weight = (distsq / delta**2)**2   ! Works the same as DISTSQ**2 (as it should be).
! !weight = (distsq / delta**2)**3  ! Not bad
! !weight = max(1.0_RP, 10.0_RP * distsq / rho**2)**3
! !weight = max(1.0_RP, 1.0E2 * distsq / rho**2)**3
! !weight = max(1.0_RP, 10.0_RP * distsq / delta**2)**3
! !weight = max(1.0_RP, 1.0E2_RP * distsq / delta**2)**3
!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
! N.B.: If DISTSQ is the square of distances to the updated XOPT, then it is WRONG to set WEIGHT to
! DISTSQ**2 or any power of DISTSQ. Why?
!
! Consider a scenario where XIMPROVED is TRUE and the new interpolation point XNEW is quite close to
! one of the existing points in the old XPT, e.g., XPT(:, J). In this case, the only appropriate
! value of KNEW is J; otherwise, the new interpolation problem will be close to degenerate and its
! KKT system will be close to singular due to the two close points in the updated interpolation set.
!
! What KNEW will be generated if KNEW = MAXLOC(DISTSQ**p * ABS(DEN))? If ||XNEW - XPT(:, J)|| = E,
! we have the following.
! 1. DISTSQ(J) = O(E**2) and DEN(J) = O(1);
! 2. for any K /= J, DIST(K) = O(1) and DEN(K) = O(E).
! Therefore, for any p > 1/2, KNEW /= J when E is small. As analyzed above, this is inappropriate.
! In addition, small values of p (e.g., p <= 1/2) always performs poorly for all Powell's methods
! in our numerical experiments.
!
! For the order of DEN, note the DEN(K) is the denominator in the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury update
! of the KKT matrix, and DEN(K) = det(new KKT matrix) / det(old KKT matrix), where "KKT matrix"
! refers to the coefficient matrix of the KKT system for the interpolation problem. See equations
! (3.10)--(3.12) of the NEWUOA paper for this matrix.
!
! Similar arguments can be made if the interpolation is fully determined. Indeed, the usage of
! DISTSQ as the weight led to a problem in COBYLA during a test on 20230501, which is the very
! motivation for the current comment.
!
! Note that Powell's LINCOA code sets DISTSQ to the square of the distance to the old XOPT, which
! avoids this problem. However, such a DISTSQ itself seems not ideal, as mentioned above.
!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!

den = calden(kopt, bmat, d, xpt, zmat, idz)
score = weight * abs(den)

! If the new F is not better than FVAL(KOPT), we set SCORE(KOPT) = -1 to avoid KNEW = KOPT.
if (.not. ximproved) then
    score(kopt) = -ONE
end if

! SCORE(K) is NaN implies ABS(DEN(K)) is NaN, but we want ABS(DEN) to be big. So we exclude such K.
score(trueloc(is_nan(score))) = -ONE

knew = 0
! The following IF works a bit better than `IF (ANY(SCORE > 1) .OR. ANY(SCORE > 0) .AND. XIMPROVED)`
! from Powell's UOBYQA and NEWUOA code.
if (any(score > 0)) then  ! Powell's BOBYQA and LINCOA code
    knew = int(maxloc(score, dim=1), kind(knew))
    !!MATLAB: [~, knew] = max(score);
end if

! Powell's code does not include the following instructions. With Powell's code, if DEN consists of
! only NaN, then KNEW can be 0 even when XIMPROVED is TRUE. Here, we set KNEW to the following value,
! to make sure that the new trial point is included in the interpolation set. However, the updating
! subroutine will likely need to skip the update of the Lagrange polynomials (i.e., H), or they
! would be destroyed by the NaNs.
if ((ximproved .and. knew == 0) .or. knew < 0) then  ! KNEW < 0 is impossible in theory.
    knew = int(maxloc(distsq, dim=1), kind(knew))

subroutine geostep(iact, idz, knew, kopt, nact, amat, bmat, delbar, qfac, rescon, xpt, zmat, feasible, s)
!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
! This subroutine finds a step S hat intends to improve the geometry of the interpolation set when
! XPT(:, KNEW) is changed to XOPT + S, where XOPT = XPT(:, KOPT).
!
! S is chosen to provide a relatively large value of the modulus of the denominator SIGMA in the
! updating formula (4.11) of the NEWUOA paper (in theory, SIGMA is positive, yet this may not hold
! numerically due to rounding errors; in the code, SIGMA is represented by DEN and its modulus by
! DENABS). This is done by solving
!
!   |LFUNC(XOPT + S)|, subject to ||S|| <= DELBAR,
!
! because SIGMA >= |LFUNC(XOPT + S)|^2 according to (4.12) of the NEWUOA paper. We do not solve this
! problem exactly, but calculate three approximate solutions as follows and then choose S from them.
! 1. The step that maximizes |LFUNC| within the trust region on the lines through XOPT and other
! interpolation points.
! 2. The gradient step that maximizes |LFUNC| within the trust region.
! 3. A projected gradient step that maximizes |LFUNC| within the trust region, the projection being
! made onto the orthogonal complement of the space spanned by the active gradients.
!
! We select S from these three steps by the following criteria.
! 1. First, set S to either the first or second step, whichever renders a larger value of |SIGMA|.
! 2. Second, override S by the third step if the latter provides a |SIGMA| that is not small
! compared with the above one, while leading to a good feasibility.
!
! N.B.:
! 1. The linear constraints are NOT considered in the calculation of the first two steps.
! 2. For the selection of S, Powell adopted a different set of criteria as follows.
! 2.1. First, set S to either the first or second step, whichever renders a larger value of |LFUNC|.
! 2.2. Second, override S by the third step if the latter provides a |LFUNC| that is not small
! compared with the above one, while being either feasible or with a constraint violation that is at
! least 0.2*DELBAR.
! 2.3. If S is not feasible and its constraint violation is less than 0.2*DELBAR, then it is
! perturbed so that the constraint violation becomes 0.2*DELBAR or more.
! 3. Powell required the positive constraint violation to be at least 0.2*DELBAR in order to keep
! the interpolation points apart. In our criteria specified above, we have removed this requirement
! as we believe that it is implied by the maximization of |LFUNC|. Our criteria works well in tests.
! 4. In terms of flops, our criteria are more expensive than Powell's due to the evaluation of SIGMA.
! In derivative-free optimization, we are willing to save function evaluations at the cost of flops.
! 5. The geometry step of BOBYQA is calculated in a fashion similar to this subroutine: first obtain
! a step by maximizing |LFUNC| along the lines through XOPT and other interpolation points, then
! find the Cauchy step, which maximizes |LFUNC| in the 1D space spanned by the gradient of LFUNC,
! and finally select the geometry step from the aforesaid steps according to the value of |LFUNC| or
! SIGMA. Yet there still exist three major differences between geometry steps of BOBYQA and LINCOA.
! 5.1. The geometry step of BOBYQA is calculated subject to the bound constraints, and the computed
! step is always feasible; the geometry step of LINCOA may violate the linear constraints.
! 5.2. BOBYQA uses an estimated value of SIGMA (see (3.11) of the BOBYQA paper) to select the step
! along the lines through XOPT and other interpolation points; LINCOA uses |LFUNC|. According to
! a test on 20220529, using the estimated SIGMA does not improve the performance of LINCOA.
! 5.3. LINCOA tries a projected gradient step and prefers this step when its quality is reasonable.
! BOBYQA does not compute such a step.
! Additionally, we observe in BOBYQA that it is beneficial for bound constrained problems (but NOT
! unconstrained ones) to take the Cauchy step only in the late stage of the algorithm, e.g., when
! DELBAR <= 1.0E-2. Similar phenomenon is not observed in LINCOA, where it worsens the performance
! of the algorithm to skip the gradient step or the projected gradient step even in the early stage.
!
! AMAT, XPT, NACT, IACT, RESCON, QFAC, KOPT are the same as the terms with these names in subroutine
! LINCOB. KNEW is the index of the interpolation point that is going to be moved. DELBAR is the
! restriction on the length of S, which is never greater than the current trust region radius DELTA.
