subroutine trstep(amat, delta, gopt_in, hq_in, pq_in, rescon, tol, xpt, iact, nact, qfac, rfac, s, ngetact)
!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
! This subroutine solves
!       minimize Q(XOPT + D)  s.t. ||D|| <= DELTA, AMAT^T*D <= B.
! It is assumed that D = 0 is feasible, namely B >= 0 except for rounding errors. See Powell 2015
! for details.
!
! AMAT, B, XPT, GOPT, HQ, PQ, NACT, IACT, RESCON, QFAC and RFAC are the same as the terms with these
! names in LINCOB.
!
! S is the total calculated step so far from the trust region centre, its final value being given by
!   the sequence of CG iterations, which terminate if the trust region boundary is reached.
! G is always the gradient of the model at the current S.
! D is the search direction of each line search.
! RESCON: If RESCON(J) is negative, then |RESCON(J)| must be no less than the trust region radius,
!   so that the J-th constraint can be ignored.
! RESNEW: A negative value of RESNEW(J) indicates that the J-th constraint does not restrict the CG
!   steps of the current trust region calculation, a zero value of RESNEW(J) indicates that the J-th
!   constraint is active, and otherwise RESNEW(J) is set to the greater of TINYCV and the actual
!   residual of the J-th constraint for the current S.
! RESACT holds the residuals of the active constraints, which may be positive.

! Scale the problem if GOPT contains large values. Otherwise, floating point exceptions may occur.
! Note that the trust-region step is scale invariant.
! N.B.: It is faster and safer to scale by multiplying a reciprocal than by division. See

! Set the initial elements of RESNEW, RESACT and S.

! 1. RESNEW(J) < 0 indicates that the J-th constraint does not restrict the CG steps of the current
! trust region calculation. In other words, RESCON >= DELTA.
! 2. RESNEW(J) = 0 indicates that J is an entry of IACT(1:NACT).
! 3. RESNEW(J) > 0 means that RESNEW(J) = max(B(J) - AMAT(:, J)^T*(XOPT+S), TINYCV), where S is the
! step up to now, calculated by a sequence of (truncated) CG iterations.
! N.B.: The order of the following lines is important, as the later ones override the earlier.
resnew = rescon
resnew(trueloc(rescon >= 0)) = max(TINYCV, rescon(trueloc(rescon >= 0)))
resnew(trueloc(rescon >= delta)) = -ONE
!!MATLAB:
!!resnew = rescon; resnew(rescon >= 0) = max(TINYCV, rescon(rescon >= 0)); resnew(rescon >= delta) = -1;
resnew(iact(1:nact)) = ZERO

! RESACT contains the constraint residuals of the constraints in IACT(1:NACT), namely the values
! of B(J) - AMAT(:, J)^T*(XOPT+S) for the J in IACT(1:NACT). Here, IACT(1:NACT) is a set of
! indicates such that the columns of AMAT(:, IACT(1:NACT)) form a basis of the constraint gradients
! in the "active set". For the definition of the "active set", see (3.5) of Powell (2015) and the
! comments at the beginning of the GETACT subroutine.
! N.B.: Between two calls of GETACT, S is updated in the orthogonal complement of the "active"
! gradients (i.e., null space of the "active" constraints). Therefore, RESACT remains unchanged.
! RESACT is changed right after GETACT is called if the first search direction D is not PSD
! but PSD + GAMMA * DPROJ.
resact(1:nact) = rescon(iact(1:nact))

! ITERCG is the number of CG iterations corresponding to the current "active set" obtained by
! calling GETACT. These CG iterations are restricted in the orthogonal complement of the active
! gradients (i.e., null space of the active constraints).
! The following initial value of ITERCG is an artificial value that is not used. It is to entertain
! Fortran compilers (can it be be removed?).
itercg = -1

! What is the THEORETICAL upper bound of ITER? For the moment, we set the following MAXITER.
! The formulation of MAXITER below contains a precaution against overflow. In MATLAB/Python/Julia/R,
! we can write maxiter = min(10000, 10*(m + n))
maxiter = int(min(10**min(4, range(0_IK)), 10 * int(m + n)), IK)
do iter = 1, maxiter  ! Powell's code is essentially a DO WHILE loop. We impose an explicit MAXITER.
    if (newact) then
        ! GETACT picks the active set for the current S. It also sets PSD to the vector closest to
        ! -G that is orthogonal to the normals of the active constraints. PSD is scaled to have
        ! length 0.2*DELTA. Then a move of PSD from S is allowed by the linear constraints: PSD
        ! reduces the values of the nearly active constraints; it changes the inactive constraints
        ! by at most 0.2*DELTA, but the residuals of these constraints at no less than 0.2*DELTA.
        ! N.B.: The magic number 0.2 appears also in GETACT (TDEL = 0.2_RP * DELTA). It works well.

        ! If the modulus of the residual of an "active constraint" is substantial (i.e., more than
        ! 1.0E-4*DELTA), then modify the searching direction PSD by a projection step to the
        ! boundaries of the "active constraint". This modified step will reduce the constraint
        ! residuals of the "active constraints" (see the update of RESACT below). The motivation is
        ! that the constraints in the "active set" are presumed to be active, and hence should have
        ! zero residuals (no constraint is violated, as the current method is feasible). According
        ! to a test on 20220821, this modification is important for the performance of LINCOA.
        ! N.B.:
        ! 1. The residual of the constraint A*X <= B is defined as B - A*X. It is not the constraint
        ! violation. Indeed, the constraint violations of the iterates are 0 in the current method.
        ! 2. We prefer `ANY(X > Y)` to `MAXVAL(X) > Y`, as Fortran standards do not specify
        ! MAXVAL(X) when X contains NaN, and MATLAB/Python/R/Julia behave differently in this
        ! respect. Moreover, MATLAB defines max(X) = [] if X == [], differing from mathematics
        ! and other languages.

    ! GAMMA is calculated), which might be an indication that he wanted to take ALPHA into account.

    ! motivation seems to avoid small steps that changes the active set, because GETACT is expensive
    ! in flops. However, according to a test on 20220820, removing this condition (essentially
    ! replacing it with ||S|| < DELTA) improves the performance of LINCOA a bit. This may lead to
